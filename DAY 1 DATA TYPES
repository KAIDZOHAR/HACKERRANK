i = 4
d = 4.0
s = 'HackerRank '
# Declare second integer, double, and String variables.
a = input()
b = input()
c = input()
# Read and save an integer, double, and String to your variables.

# Print the sum of both integer variables on a new line.
print(i + int(a))

# Print the sum of the double variables on a new line.
print(d + float(b))

# Concatenate and print the String variables on a new line
print(s + c)
# The 's' variable above should be printed first.





# KEY LESSONS 
#1 NEVER HARDCODE ALWAYS TAKE INPUT
#2 INTEGERS CAN ONLY BE ADDED TO INTEGERS AND FLOATS TO FLOATS
#3 INPUT IS ALWAYS A STRING 
#4 CHANGE INPUT TO A SUITABLE TYPE BEFORE OPERATIONS
